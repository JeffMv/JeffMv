I publish my playlist of youtube ad campaign videos.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD2-u2e1pRflqM-VrPVIRci5g7AO3s8tg



Among my goals were:
> A record of ads that were presented to youtube audiences. 
> - One main purpose of this playlist if for you to get inspiration for your own marketing >campaign.
> - Another purpose is to serve as benchmark, by providing you with an access to the ad's stats.
> - It could also be used to estimate the potential revenue of an ad campaign (for instance, by considering an hypothetical 0.1% or whatever % of CTR) or the campaign video cost.
> 
> Some ad videos were not meant to be viewed  outside of the campaign, hence some video names can be weird. Don't mind that.

And you can find it [explained here](https://www.producthunt.com/makers/1-makers/discussion/60028-evaluate-your-marketing-campaign-with-this-list-of-ads-and-their-stats). The explaination is copied here though.



Today I share with you a playlist of Youtube Ads (and *their stats*) that I saved to serve as reference for when I'll be making my own ad campaign.

The way I initially planned to use it was to compare several ad videos, how they were made (5-15 seconds intro, the use of a sense emergency, charisma of the MC, voice intonation, use of humour, and so on...) and have a look at their stats (# of views, reactions, # of subscribers of the channel, # of views of other videos on the channel, ...).

Hopefully, the stats of an ad video and the corresponding channel would give me an idea of how successful that business / economical agent is. This in turn giving me the hunch to trust or not their approach, or just reflect on my own approach in the light of what they did.

All this combined, and that would become some learning material towards growing in the art of marketing campaigns... well, that's what I hope ðŸ˜„   What do you guys think ?


Share this post as you please. I'm sure it can be of great help, and moreover prove invaluable to someone working in a marketing agency or such.
Feedbacks are welcome!

A Poll: what do you think of this dataset ?

-[ ] Super helpful! Will share it ðŸ˜ƒ
-[ ] I would prefer a dataset out of this for analytics or machine learning ðŸ“Š
-[ ] I would also like to save ad videos by myself. ðŸ“¹
-[ ] Helpful, but not that much
