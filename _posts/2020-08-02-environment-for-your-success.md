## In which country do we find the most top sellers ?

The dataset associated with this project shows data about sellers, such as the number of sales each of them made on an online  C2C store for secondhand fashion.​

**Opportunities**

This allows us to explore the location of the best sellers among them. As it was already mentioned in other parts of this project, knowing where the top fashion sellers come from creates multiple positive opportunities, among which:


* knowing where one could get training from the best (fashion) salespeople
* getting tips and inspiration from the strategies of these top sellers

This is where this visualisation comes to shine a light.
The idea is to split the sellers between normal and successful ones (hereafter referred to as "_top sellers_") depending on the number of products they successfully sold.
Note: you will be able to play around with the threshold in the annexed query through the template parameter.

Now that the top sellers have been isolated, we can create visualisations to study them.

**Comparing strategies using data**

The first thing I would like to explore is to oppose 2 common strategies taught and used by millions in order to see which one is the best:


* following people/user accounts (in order to catch the eye of a potential client by getting in their notification center)
* putting efforts into growing a list of followers, so that they would get notified whenever you publish something new like a new product, thus giving you free impressions

Ideally, one would want to have both, but the efforts they require mean one might prefer focusing on one approach to do it best, rather than being a jack of all trade but master of none.

The following graphs show visualisations of top sellers and their _number of follow**ers**_ **vs** _number of accounts they follow_, grouped by countries. Each point represent a single country and the average of its sellers.
This way we can compare the measure of success for both approaches: having more followers vs poking other users (i.e. for instance following more accounts).

This graph uses the mean of products sold by top sellers to give the size to a point.
This allows seing which countries sold the most by their top sellers.
Also note that the scale is **_not_** linear. This is meant to keep the graph clearer, among other things.

One thing to note though (as it will appear on the next graph, this previous one does not account for the number of top sellers in a country. As a matter of fact, _Monaco_ only has 1 seller, but this 1 seller sold a lot (hence the mean of 170 is 170).

​

### A culture of top sellers
In the following graph, the **size of the points is given by the number of top sellers in a country.** The more top sellers in a country, the more likely it is that its people are aware of good selling principles and techniques.

​

​

In this graph, we see that countries with the most top sellers are Italy, France, UK, Spain and then the US.
Since Italy has the highest number of talented sellers, it seems legit to think they either have a proficient culture of selling fashion products, or the products they sold are really better than what can be found in other countries.
Since the website this data comes from is an international C2C fashion website for secondhand products, any seller of any country should theoretically have acceess to the same pool of secondhand products, thus giving more weight and credibility to the first hypothesis, i.e. italians being better at selling fashion products.

This result would be correlated by the fact that Italy has a renown fashion capital known worldwide (Milan), alongside the fact that so many established luxury brands originated from there. All this is proof of an ability to advertise and sell fashion products.

The same reasoning could similarly be applied to the other top countries mentioned above, because they each own one of the very few influencial fashion capitals _of Europe_: Paris (France), London (UK) and Milan (Italy). Some articles mentioned Madrid (Spain) as being a rising fashion capital, which would explain the ranking of spain in the graph above.

Since the website the data originated from is a European platform, it makes sense they would be reprensented. Honorable mention for the US (with its fashion capital New York) and their number of top sellers, despite the fact that the website is orignally from Europe and expanding accross continents.
However, it is worth noting that the dataset also shows that while the US had quite a decent amount of top sellers, they also had a lot of average sellers, which may be imputed to several reasons, such as the fact that it is a big country with a lot of diversity, too big for the sole fashion capital to radiate to every single seller.

​

​

**Thoughts summary**


* Italy, France and UK all have fashion capitals. Their over-representation in the number of top sellers shows that there is an expertise there.
* Being part of a country with a fashion capital seem to help get trust from clients, along with tips on how to be an excellent fashion seller.
