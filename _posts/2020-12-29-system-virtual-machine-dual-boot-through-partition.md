## Independant Virtual Machine, or How to create a VM that can be dual booted



##### Goals

- Having a VM to do tasks on Host and work on guest at the same time, sharing data
- Having the ability to exploit full capabilities of guest OS by booting into it as a full-fledged configuration (dual boot).
  - Using full power of your hardware from the child OS
- 



> ### Why run it natively?
>
> *To play games*. Or to be able to use 100% of the hardware resources for other applications, if you're into productivity and those things... VMs are much more convienent for everything else.
>
> ### Why run a VM?
>
> VMs are super convenient for many reasons:
>
> - They can run side-by-side with macOS without partitioning, rebooting, etc...
> - You don't have to reboot
> - They can be backed up
> - You don't have to reboot
> - You can use snapshots to revert immediately back to working installations
> - You don't have to reboot
> - They can integrate with the host OS for the purposes of transferring files, running guest OS-specific applications, etc...
> - *You don't have to reboot*

Other goals

- [For programs more hungry in resources.]
- If your computer is slow
  - MacOS is slow. Running a VM will be sluggish
  - Windows will be fast





##### How



- Create a virtual disk that is linked to a physical partition
  - Variations: for an external drive

- 



##### Troubleshooting

Possible issues

- playing with the "Use I/O cache". When I tried using my *internal* drive, it wouldn't work without it.
  Some people in earlier versions of VirtualBox tried needed to disable that option to make things work. You can learn more at [these threads]().

A Poll: what do you think of this dataset ?

-[ ] Super helpful! Will share it ðŸ˜ƒ
-[ ] I would prefer a dataset out of this for analytics or machine learning ðŸ“Š
-[ ] I would also like to save ad videos by myself. ðŸ“¹
-[ ] Helpful, but not that much
